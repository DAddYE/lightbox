LightBoxObject v.1.1
====================
This LightBox Helper is based on the lastest javascript http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/

It's only make an helper, copy the lastest javascripts, css, and images on your public/javascript directory
and register the javascript in the AssetTagHelper of rails,
so for include the javascript in your page you only can add this (if you havn't yet):

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

You must add also the stylesheet so add this on your page head:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'lightbox' %>

The is very simple for add a LightBox in your page add this:

<%= lightbox_link_to "Link Name", "/path/of/your/image.png" %> 
or
<%= lightbox_image_tag("/path/of/your/image-thumb.png", "/path/of/your/image.png", {:class=>"images"}, :title => "This is a test!") %>

You can add, title, controller, action what do u whant becaue it's based on image_tag and link_to.
